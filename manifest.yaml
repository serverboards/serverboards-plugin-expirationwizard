  Shows the fuure expirations in a timeline.

  Expirations are defined by components by plugins and may contain things as
  SSL expirations, contract expirations, Domain Name expirations and so on.

  It also contains simple rules to create issues when the expirations are
  getting close to the due data.

  This is not a calendar service in a classical sense as all the items it
  contains are get from the real world and are not user updatable unless some
  action is taken to extend the expiration.
